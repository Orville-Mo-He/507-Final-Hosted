Hi~

This was a project for a class, where I had to use Python to access api's, scrape websies, make graphs, and the such. I did mine on modern love and the perseverance of love desipite "trying" times (to put it mildly), which is showcased via the moving graph that shows the front page headlines of each tiny love story's publishing date.

I DO NOT CLAIM OWNERSHIP TO ANY OF THE STORIES AND OR HEADLINES. Those are founded in the New York Times Modern Love section, specifically Tiny Love Stories, and the Authors/storytellers/storyowners are cited after each story. 

(IE mine = code)
(IE pls don't copyright strike me).
